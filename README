This is an overlay for streaming live MtG games via OBS.

The overlay is implemented in HTML/CSS/JS and the data source is Firebase.

TODOs:
  * Get a logotype
  * Make overlay2.html pretty
  * Make overlay2.html integrate with Firebase
  * A more reasonable Firebase schema?
  	* At least, one that supports cards-in-hand
  	* Poison counters
  * Integrate with mtgjson or something similar to render mana costs given card names

  * A second HTML page, editor.html or director.html or such, which writes into Firebase
  	* Quick buttons for -1/-2/-3 life
  	* A "won the game" button for each player that increments gamewins and resets life totals to 20
  	* Store names and sideboards (and whole decklists?) somewhere else in Firebase, and copy them into player1 & player2
  * Functionality for spotters to keep hands up to date, with autocomplete. Usable from mobile is ideal
